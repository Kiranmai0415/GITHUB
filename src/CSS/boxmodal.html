        <p>Everything displayed by CSS is a box. Understanding how the CSS Box Model
            works is therefore a core foundation of CSS.
            The content would break out of your element and it would be 142px wide,
            rather than 100px. Why is that?
            The box model is a core foundation of CSS and understanding how it works,
            how it is affected by other aspects of CSS and importantly,
            how you can control it will help you to write more predictable CSS. </p>
